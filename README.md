A simple message queue

## Message Queue
Message queue means that you put something in a place, someone else could get it.
Two keys are essential:
1. The producer put the message in sequence.
2. The consumer get the message also in sequence.

## Self-Cursor Control of Consumer
Consumer handles itself message position, which is independent with message production.
